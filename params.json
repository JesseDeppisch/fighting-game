{"name":"Fighting-game","tagline":"A fighting game that a few high schoolers are working on.","body":"### Welcome to our fighting game Github page!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd fighting-game/master\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\nSorry that this doesn't work currently!\r\n\r\n### What is this project all about?\r\nThis project is all about testing our Java coding progress, and to pose a challenge to us. The game is a 2D fighting game, and we're utilizing the [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) library to make it a bit easier. We hope for it to be similar to other fighting games, such as street fighter, but this project is really about **learning**, _not_ creating a beautiful end project (that'd be nice, too). So, keep this in mind.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n+ Jesse Deppisch - @JesseDeppisch\r\n+ Mitchell Kaysen - @MitchellKaysen\r\n+ Justin Cao \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact Jesse Deppisch at jessedeppisch@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
